Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Convert data types, standardize units, and format timestamps.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct initial data exploration to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
Create summary statistics, visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots), and identify patterns.

4. Key Metrics and KPIs:
Define relevant metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) for the analysis. These may include:
Average trip duration
Trip frequency
Peak hours and locations
Driver ratings and reviews
User demographics

5. Driver Analysis:
Analyze driver behavior and performance:
Driver earnings
Acceptance and cancellation rates
Driver ratings
Driver locations
Time spent online

6. Passenger Analysis:
